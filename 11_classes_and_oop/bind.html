<!--What Happens Internally
1.Binding Process:

-> this.handleClick.bind(this) creates a new function.

-> This new function has its this permanently set to the React instance.


2.New Bound Function:

-> The bound function (this.boundHandleClick) is assigned as the event handler.
When the button is clicked, this bound function is invoked. -->


<!-- code part -->

<!-- this.boundHandleClick = this.handleClick.bind(this); -->

<!-- document.querySelector('button').addEventListener('click', this.boundHandleClick); -->
